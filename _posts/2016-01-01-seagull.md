From 2016 - 2019, I design, coded, and managed the websites for counterculture NYC staple [Seagull Salon](https://seagullhair.com), Seagull's new [nail bar](http://seagullnailsalonnyc.com), and stylist [Shaun Surething's personal site](https://shaunsurething.com).

<div class="device border-desktop"><a href="#" data-featherlight="/assets/images/posts/seagull.gif"><img src="/assets/images/posts/seagull.gif" alt="Landing animation for Seagull Salon." title="Landing animation for Seagull Salon." class="device-interior"></a></div>

For this iconic feminist brand, a templated Squarespace or Wix site just couldn't reflect their aesthetic and energy. I developed custom animations and a bold look across the brand directly in collaboration with owners Shaun Surething and Johanna Fateman.

But it wasn't all aesthetics. Significant work went into SEO optimization, file management, and security.
