In 2015, I was one of the awardees of the inaugural Rhizome microgrants, and ultimately lost my $500 award in a bitcoin exit scam on the deep web. What began as a fairly facecious proposal to try and hire a hacker to get myself the Twitter handle I wanted ended in a series of bizarre rabbitholes and a lot of anxious nightmares about ending up on an FBI watchlist. This was peak mid-10s performative social media, and I still feel a bit weird about it.
