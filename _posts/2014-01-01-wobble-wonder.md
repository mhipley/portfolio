Wobble Wonder was a collaboration with[ Sophi Kravitz](http://mix-engineering.com), [Adelle Lin](http://adelleninja.com), and [Takafumi Ide](http://blog.takafumiide.com), originally conceived at Thoughtworks' inaugural Art-A-Hack.

The project incorporates custom hardware for an immersive experience of "surfing" through a psychedelic virtual world. this was my first foray into VR, and I was lucky to have the opportunity to assist with visual concepting, narrative design, 3D modeling, and animation.
