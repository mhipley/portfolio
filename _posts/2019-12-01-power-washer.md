On a lazy summer day, your favorite aunt asks you to complete a simple favor that opens a world of mystery and cleaning. As you power wash around the globe, you’re invited to bigger and better gigs an uncover details about your parents’ disappearance and a dark conspiracy,  My Pal Power Washer is a visual novel/physics game hybrid about finding out what’s the real dirt.

Why do so many people love watching videos of [manual labor](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerwashingporn/comments/eazj9x/been_a_while_since_this_has_last_been_done/), [skilled labor](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterEveryLoop/comments/eb6fdu/belly_eating_coins_one_by_one/), [perfect fits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfectfit/comments/eaj7xr/vacuuming/), and [oddly satisfying moments](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/eaz2gt/making_of_fusilli_using_chopsticks/)? Why is it so relaxing to watch someone else [vacuum the cat hair off of their carpet](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerwashingporn/comments/dfgjlx/two_cats_and_two_dogs_shedding_on_this_carpet_for/)? This game is a satire of this world of virtual labor, with its own narraive of corruption and contamination. Who cleans the cleaners?
