As part of my duties at Withfriends, I did lead generation, wrote copy, and managed drip campaigns for locally targeted leads. Here’s an example of a sequence of emails for a campaign targeted at leads based in Baltimore, Maryland, my hometown. As a result of this campaign, several high profile accounts onboarded to the platform, our firsts in the region, including [Current Space](https://www.currentspace.com) and [Red Emma’s](https://www.redemmas.org), and the campaign had a overall **open rate of 46%**.

#### Step 1 - Day 1

Subject: Boost your organization’s income with memberships.

Copy: Withfriends runs memberships for event organizers. Even if you already run a membership program or accept donations, you can grow your organization's income by **20% - 300% per year** by selling tickets or collecting RSVPs on Withfriends. Isn't that incredible! 

As an artist and organizer myself, I'm bringing my years of experience towards making Withfriends the best tool for building a strong membership program. From a large-scale cultural center like [Pioneer Works](https://withfriends.co/pioneer_works), to a small neighborhood art gallery like [Paradice Palase](https://withfriends.co/paradice_palase), we're already supporting 200 event organizers. I want you to be one of them!

Copy: This week my cofounders were profiled (alongside a bunch of other inspiring organizers) in a long read on Vice about the issues facing community spaces trying to survive and grow in changing cities around the country: [*"DIY*](http://bit.ly/diywithfriendsvice)[ *Spaces Go Mainstream to Survive"*](http://bit.ly/diywithfriendsvice)

San Francisco is changing, and it's important to me that the city holds onto the spaces and people that make it special.

No newsletters, no tote bags, you can just use the events you already put on to find excited members among your fans!

I hope to hear from you!
