For Material Art Fair 2018, I designed and developed a site to house video works curated by [Nika Chilewich](https://hyperallergic.com/author/nika-chilewich/) as part of [Trapos Sucios](https://www.lararte.org/trapos-sucios), a satellite program in the San Rafael neighborhood of Mexico City. The site was displayed in a local internet cafe, where fair goers and locals alike could explore works by [Joiri Minaya](http://www.joiriminaya.com), [Núria Güell](http://nuriaguell.net), [Javier Ocampo](https://queerland.tumblr.com), [Básica TV](https://basicatv.com), [Casey Jane Ellison](https://www.caseyjaneellison.com), and Havi.
