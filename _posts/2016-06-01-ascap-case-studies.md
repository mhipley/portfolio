At ASCAP, I also worked closely with the data science team to develop interactive visualizations for case studies, for use in internal strategy presentations. The prototypes were designed and built in D3 to be reusable with new seasonal data. The visualizations made it effortless to call out new trends, which was particularly eye-opening for senior strategists in an industry that relies on “gut feelings.”
