summary: "At ASCAP I worked on several internal data products, including interactive reporting tools for members."

I was also responsible for data visualization design and development for ASCAP's new member platform. After extensive user interviews, we determined that comprehensive, narrative visualizations of member revenue would add value to ASCAP's member services and aid in member retention.

I designed and built visualizations in d3 to reflect both revenue trends over time and quarterly distributions of revenue by region, platform, and type of performance.
