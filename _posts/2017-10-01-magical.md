*make ur own magical girl* was an introduction to AR for the web for teens that I taught at Tec de Monterrey, Mexico City. Lecture slides available [here](https://slides.com/marthahipley/ar-intro/fullscreen).

The students worked from guided examples to make their own interactive works about identity, privacy, and futurism.
