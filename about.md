summary: "Martha Hipley is an artist and technologist working in digital and paint, based in Mexico City."

---

I’m an experienced designer and autodidact technologist, with a professional background that ranges from pre-seed startups to 100+-year-old organizations. I specialize in UX-centered product design, development, and management, and I have hands-on experience with all steps of the product cycle.

I’m also an artist and technologist working in digital and paint, occasionally under the brand everyoneisugly. My work explores identity formation through the lens of fandom culture and nascent sexuality, as well as the tensions between commercial technology and human rights. In addition to being awarded a Rhizome microgrant for her project “Untitled Twitter Hack,” I’m the second best web surfer in the world. 

My work in product design and user experience led her to participate as a founder of Withfriends in Y Combinator’s Winter 2019 cohort. I’m based between New York and Mexico City, and I’m available for new opportunities.
